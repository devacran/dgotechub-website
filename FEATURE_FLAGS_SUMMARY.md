# Feature Flags Implementation Summary

## ✅ What has been implemented:

### 1. Feature Flags Infrastructure

- Created `/src/lib/feature-flags.ts` with two main functions:
  - `shouldShowTicketGoals()`: Controls ticket goals and progress tracking
  - `shouldShowPartyInfo()`: Controls party promotional content

### 2. Environment Variables

- Added to `.env.local`:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_TICKET_GOALS=false`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_PARTY_INFO=false`

### 3. Updated Components

#### Navigation Bar (`src/components/globals/Navbar.tsx`)

- ✅ Tickets button in navigation only shows when `shouldShowPartyInfo()` is true
- ✅ Clean navigation when party information is disabled

#### Home Page (`src/app/(site)/page.tsx`)

- ✅ PartyPromo component now only shows when `shouldShowPartyInfo()` is true
- ✅ EventProgressMeter only shows when both flags are true
- ✅ LiveActivityFeed only shows when both flags are true

#### Admin Dashboard (`src/components/tickets/EventStatsAdmin.tsx`)

- ✅ Goal-related statistics hidden when `shouldShowTicketGoals()` is false
- ✅ Progress tracking disabled when goals are hidden
- ✅ Promotional messages updated to exclude goals when disabled

#### Tickets Page (`src/app/(site)/tickets/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Already implemented - EventProgressMeterCompact only shows when both flags are true

#### Existing Components Already Implemented:

- ✅ `EventProgressMeter` - Has feature flag checks
- ✅ `EventProgressMeterCompact` - Has feature flag checks
- ✅ `LiveActivityFeed` - Has feature flag checks
- ✅ `PartyPromo` - Has feature flag checks

### 4. Documentation

- ✅ Updated main README.md with feature flags section
- ✅ Created comprehensive FEATURE_FLAGS.md documentation
- ✅ Added test script to verify implementation

## 🎯 Current State:

Both feature flags are set to `false`, which means:

- ❌ Ticket goals are hidden
- ❌ Party information is hidden
- ❌ Progress meters are hidden
- ❌ Live activity feed is hidden

## 🔄 How to Control Features:

### For Future Events:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_TICKET_GOALS=false  # Hide goals until needed
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_PARTY_INFO=true     # Show party info
```

### During Active Events:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_TICKET_GOALS=true   # Show goals and progress
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_PARTY_INFO=true     # Show party info
```

### After Events End:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_TICKET_GOALS=false  # Hide goals
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_PARTY_INFO=false    # Hide party info
```

## 🚀 Benefits:

1. **Easy Control**: Toggle features without code changes
2. **Event Lifecycle**: Manage content through different event phases
3. **Clean UI**: Hide irrelevant content when not needed
4. **Future Ready**: Ready for future events without code modification
5. **Flexible**: Can show party info without goals or vice versa

## 📋 Next Steps:

1. Change environment variables when you want to enable features
2. Restart development server after changing .env.local
3. Deploy with appropriate flag values for production
4. Monitor user experience with different flag combinations

Run `./test-feature-flags.sh` to verify the implementation anytime.
